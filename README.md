## 📌 Project Overview

This project implements a **Logistic Regression** model to classify whether a student is likely to be placed (`Yes`) or not (`No`) during campus recruitment. The application provides an interactive and user-friendly interface where users can input student details and receive an instant prediction along with a confidence score.

While the dataset contains numerous features, this model is currently trained on the following key predictors:
* **IQ Score**
* **CGPA**
* **Internship Experience**

## ✨ Features

<ul>
    <li>🚀 **Interactive UI:** Clean and simple interface built with Streamlit.</li>
    <li>🧠 **ML Model Integration:** Uses a trained Logistic Regression model from Scikit-learn.</li>
    <li>📊 **Dynamic Prediction:** Takes user inputs from a sidebar to generate real-time predictions.</li>
    <li>📈 **Confidence Score:** Displays the placement probability as a percentage.</li>
    <li>📋 **Data Display:** Includes an option to view the raw dataset used for training the model.</li>
</ul>

## 🚀 Finally starting Raje
📂 Dataset
The model is trained on the college_student_placement_dataset.csv file, which contains various attributes related to students’ academic performance, skills, and final placement status.

🔮 Future Enhancements
Potential improvements for the project include:

<ul>
<li><b>Feature Expansion:</b> Incorporate more features like Communication Skills, Projects Completed, and Extra-Curriculars to improve model accuracy.</li>
<li><b>Model Exploration:</b> Experiment with other classification models such as Random Forest, XGBoost, or Support Vector Machines (SVM).</li>
<li><b>Deployment:</b> Deploy the application to a cloud platform like Streamlit Cloud, Heroku, or AWS for public access.</li>
<li><b>Dashboarding:</b> Add a dashboard to visualize key insights from the dataset.</li>
</ul>
